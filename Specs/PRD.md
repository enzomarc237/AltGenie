# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Alternatives Generator App

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 High-Level Vision
To empower users with a fast, intelligent, and context-aware tool accessible directly from their macOS menubar, enabling them to effortlessly discover suitable alternatives for applications, services, and websites, thereby fostering efficiency, informed choices, and exploration of new digital solutions.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
In today's dynamic digital landscape, users often find themselves locked into familiar software or services, unaware of potentially better, more affordable, privacy-focused, or open-source alternatives. Discovering these alternatives through traditional search engines can be time-consuming, yield irrelevant results, and lack intelligent contextual understanding. This fragmentation of information prevents users from optimizing their digital toolkit and exploring solutions that better fit their evolving needs.

### 1.3 Goals
1.  **Efficiency**: Provide users with a rapid and seamless way to find alternatives directly from their macOS menubar, minimizing workflow disruption.
2.  **Intelligence**: Leverage cutting-edge AI to deliver highly relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate alternative suggestions.
3.  **Accessibility**: Ensure that information about alternatives, including their names, descriptions, and direct URLs, is easily digestible and actionable.
4.  **Trust**: Build a reliable tool that users can depend on for high-quality recommendations.
5.  **Expandability**: Architect the application for future cross-platform expansion while prioritizing a native-like macOS experience initially.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

    *   Official URL (string)
*   **FR3.4**: The system must handle cases where the AI model cannot find any relevant alternatives, displaying an appropriate "No alternatives found" message to the user.
*   **FR3.5**: Implement basic context awareness for common queries (e.g., differentiating "Slack" as a communication app from "slack" as an adjective).

### FR4: Results Display & Interaction
*   **FR4.1**: The search interface must display the AI-generated alternatives as a scrollable list below the search input.
*   **FR4.2**: Each alternative in the list must clearly show its Name, Description, and URL.

*   **FR6.2**: The backend service must securely manage AI API keys, preventing client-side exposure.
*   **FR6.3**: Implement rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse of the AI service.

### Technical Stack Choice (Flutter for UI, Serverless Backend for AI)
*   **UI Framework**: Flutter (with `macos_ui` for native aesthetics and `system_tray` for menubar integration).
*   **Backend**: Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for AI API orchestration.
*   **AI Service**: A large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini Pro).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
*   **5.1.1 Responsiveness**: The UI must remain responsive during network requests to the AI service. Loading indicators should be displayed promptly.
*   **5.1.2 Latency**: Search results (from query submission to display) should appear within 3-5 seconds under normal network conditions, excluding initial AI model warm-up on the backend.
*   **5.1.3 Resource Usage**: The application must have a minimal footprint on system resources (CPU, RAM) when idle in the menubar (e.g., <50MB RAM, <1% CPU).
*   **5.1.4 Startup Time**: The application should launch and be ready for interaction within 2 seconds.

### 5.2 Scalability
*   **5.2.1 Backend Scalability**: The backend AI service infrastructure must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate an increasing number of concurrent user queries.
*   **5.2.2 AI Model Flexibility**: The backend should be architected to allow easy integration of alternative AI models or updates to existing ones without requiring client-side updates.
*   **5.2.3 Data Volume**: The system should be capable of handling a growing volume of queries and potential user feedback without performance degradation.

### 5.3 Security
*   **5.3.1 API Key Management**: AI API keys must be stored securely on the backend, never exposed on the client-side. Access to these keys must be restricted.
*   **5.3.2 Data Transmission**: All communication between the client application, backend service, and AI provider must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
*   **5.3.3 Input Sanitization**: User input must be sanitized on both the client and backend to prevent injection attacks (e.g., prompt injection for AI).
*   **5.3.4 Privacy**: No personally identifiable information (PII) should be collected, stored, or transmitted without explicit user consent. User queries should be anonymized where possible.
*   **5.3.5 Vulnerability Management**: Regular security audits and dependency updates must be part of the development lifecycle.

### 5.4 Usability
*   **5.4.1 Intuitive Interface**: The menubar app interface must be simple, clear, and easy for new users to understand and operate without a steep learning curve.
*   **5.4.2 Consistency**: Adhere to macOS human interface guidelines for menubar applications and general UI elements, leveraging `macos_ui` for a native look and feel.
*   **5.4.3 Accessibility**: Support for basic accessibility features such as keyboard navigation (within the popover), adjustable text sizes (system-level), and sufficient color contrast.
*   **5.4.4 Error Handling**: Clear and user-friendly error messages for network issues, AI service failures, or invalid input.

### 5.5 Maintainability
*   **5.5.1 Code Quality**: The codebase must be well-structured, modular, documented (e.g., inline comments, architectural diagrams), and follow established coding standards.
*   **5.5.2 Testability**: The application components (UI, backend logic, AI integration) must be unit-testable and integration-testable.
*   **5.5.3 Deployment**: Automated build and deployment pipelines for client and backend components.

### 5.6 Reliability
*   **5.6.1 Stability**: The application should be robust and not crash under various conditions, including network failures, AI service outages, or unexpected user input.
*   **5.6.2 Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation of functionality in case of external service failures (e.g., display a message that AI service is unavailable instead of crashing).
*   **5.6.3 Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity of data exchanged between client and backend.

## 6. Assumptions & Dependencies

### 6.1 Assumptions
*   **AI Service Availability & Performance**: We assume that a capable AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) is readily available via API, provides reliable performance, and is cost-effective for the anticipated query volume.
*   **AI Model Accuracy**: We assume the chosen AI model can accurately understand user queries for applications, services, and websites, and consistently generate relevant and high-quality alternatives with valid URLs and descriptions.
*   **Internet Connectivity**: Users will have an active and stable internet connection to utilize the core AI-powered search functionality.
*   **User Understanding**: Users will understand that the alternatives are AI-generated and may require their own due diligence for final selection.
*   **Initial Platform Focus**: While the chosen tech stack supports cross-platform, the initial development and user experience focus will be primarily on macOS.

### 6.2 Dependencies
*   **AI Service Provider**:
    *   Specific API access (e.g., OpenAI API Key, Google Cloud Project for Gemini API).
    *   Adherence to the AI provider's Terms of Service and Usage Policies.
    *   Billing account setup for AI service usage.
*   **Backend Infrastructure**:
    *   A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for deploying serverless functions and potentially other backend services (e.g., API Gateway, Secrets Manager).
    *   Necessary IAM roles and permissions for backend service access to AI APIs and other resources.
*   **Flutter SDK**:
    *   Flutter development environment installed and configured.
    *   Specific Flutter packages: `macos_ui` for native macOS styling, `system_tray` for menubar integration, `http`/`dio` for network requests, `url_launcher` for opening URLs, `shared_preferences` for local settings.
*   **Operating System**:
    *   macOS (minimum version to be determined based on Flutter/package compatibility, e.g., macOS 10.15 Catalina or newer).
*   **Third-Party Libraries/Services**:
    *   Any other open-source or commercial libraries used in client or backend development.
*   **External Data Sources**:
    *   The AI model's training data for generating alternatives. We do not explicitly manage a separate database of alternatives.
